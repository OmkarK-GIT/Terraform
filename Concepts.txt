Providers-
 		
	Is a Plugin, that helps Terraform to understand the where this resource has to be 	create. 
	We actually mentioned the Cloud provider or where we have to create the resources. 


	If we want to create the resources in the multiple regions at the same time, So we  	just need to create the Alias for the provider and use that alias in the resource 	as a provider. Ex. 
			proider "aws" {
			alias = "us-east-1"
			region = "us-ease-1"
			}
			
			
			provider "aws" {
			alias = "us-west-2"
			region = "us-west-2"
			}
	And use the above resources in a resource block,
			resource "aws_instance" "Example"{
			ami ="ami-00449277824662fs94"
			instance_type = "t2.micro"
			provider = "aws.us-east-1"
			}
			
			
			resource "aws_instance" "Example"{
			ami ="ami-00449277824662fs94"
			instance_type = "t2.micro"
			provider = "aws.us-west-2"
			}


		You can use multiple providers in one single terraform project. For 			example,

		Create a providers.tf file in the root directory of your Terraform 			project.
		In the providers.tf file, define the AWS and Azure providers. For example:
		provider "aws" {
 		 region = "us-east-1"
			}

		provider "azurerm" {
  		subscription_id = "your-azure-subscription-id"
  		client_id = "your-azure-client-id"
  		client_secret = "your-azure-client-secret"
  		tenant_id = "your-azure-tenant-id"
		}
		In your other Terraform configuration files, you can then use the aws and 		azurerm providers to create resources in AWS and Azure, respectively,
		resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  		ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  		instance_type = "t2.micro"
		}

		resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
 		 name = "example-vm"
 		 location = "eastus"
  			size = "Standard_A1"
			}




Variables:
	To define a variable we use the terraform.var file, where we can define the input variable and use this variable the resources. Also we can create a multiple var.tf file ex. dev.var.tf & prod.var.tf, to segregate the infrastructure.
